I had the exciting opportunity to craft a captivating landing page using HTML and CSS. My project was centered around the Cafe House, a renowned local restaurant. Incorporating essential elements like a dynamic menu display, an intuitive order form, and precise restaurant location details, I strived to provide a seamless user experience.

To enhance user engagement, I leveraged transitions and animations, making the page more interactive and appealing. Furthermore, I implemented a clever feature that allows users to toggle between light and dark modes based on their system preferences, ensuring a comfortable reading experience.

For an aesthetically pleasing look, I drew inspiration from real-time color websites, selecting the perfect color palette to elevate the visual appeal of the Cafe House landing page.
